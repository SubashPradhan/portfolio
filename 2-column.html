          <h3>John Kerry demands Syria aircraft grounded as UN debates ceasefire</h3>
          <p>
            US Secretary of State John Kerry has called for aircraft to be grounded in parts of Syria so a ceasefire deal can be extended.
            Mr Kerry said he believed there was a way forward "out of the carnage", but that the future of the country was "hanging by a thread". 
            He added that international diplomats were proving "woefully inadequate" in getting Syrian parties to negotiate.
            His impassioned speech at the United Nations followed an attack on an aid convoy on Monday and came as fighting broke out on numerous fronts in the war-torn country.

          <h3>Syria twins reveal fear of barrel bombs and suffocating under rubble</h3>
          <p>
            Twin six-year-old girls have revealed how their life in Syria is overshadowed by fears the next barrel bomb will leave them suffocating under rubble or with horrific burns.Speaking from Talbiseh, about eight miles from the war-scarred city of Homs, Safa and Marwa spoke about seeing children burnt and covered in dust.
            Safa is scared of being killed by the barrel bombs pushed out of Syrian government aircraft over rebel-held areas."I am afraid I will suffocate under the rubble. I am afraid the ceiling will fall over me," says the six-year-old.Barrel bombs are improvised bombs - usually a barrel-shaped container filled with explosives and dropped from a helicopter.They are unguided and rarely accurate and have been widely used in areas with civilian populations.

          <p>
            Apple has reportedly approached McLaren about an investment or potential takeover - but the car maker denies holding any talks with the US company.The Financial Times - which cites three sources it says have knowledge of the negotiations - said the loss-making Formula One team owner could be valued at between £1bn and £1.5bn.McLaren said it was "not in discussion" with the US firm but that it regularly held "confidential conversations with a wide range of parties".The statement did not deny that there had been an approach.A deal could give Apple access to key automotive technology amid reports that it is working on a self-driving car.It comes a couple of weeks after US firm Liberty Media agreed to buy Formula One in a £6bn deal.

          <h3>FBI searches for men who took bomb from New York suitcase</h3>
          <p>
            The FBI is seeking two men seen removing a bomb from a suitcase in New York - in the same hour that another explosive device detonated just a few blocks away.The men - who are being sought as witnesses not suspects - appeared to take the suitcase, leaving the bomb behind.The development comes just hours after federal prosecutors charged Ahmad Khan Rahami, the main suspect in the New York-New Jersey weekend bombings, with using a weapon of mass destruction.Rahami, 28, is accused of planting the bombs, including one which injured 31 people when it blew up on a bustling Manhattan street.

          <h3>Brexit deal 'must be inferior' to membership, EU leader warns</h3>
          <p>
            The EU leader preparing to chair Brexit negotiations has told Sky News the UK is "between a rock and a hard place" and will be offered an "inferior" trade deal.Joseph Muscat, the Prime Minister of Malta, told Sky News on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York that he had told Theresa May: "Most of my colleagues want a fair deal for both the UK and Europe, but it has to be a deal that is inferior to membership, so you can't have the cake and eat it."I don't see a situation where Britain will be better off at the end of the deal."Dr Muscat's comments are significant because Malta is the set to hold the rotating EU presidency, meaning it will chair the initial Brexit negotiations if Mrs May triggers Article 50 early next year, as she has indicated.He is also one of 27 EU leaders who met in Bratislava last week to plot a course for the EU without the UK.
